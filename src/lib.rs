//! Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc) traits
//!
//! Note that no operator sugar is provided, i.e. `x += y` won't use these traits.
//!
//! This crate is only  a convenience for me, as I've the need of using these traits as bounds in
//! some of my libraries, and I'd rather not duplicate the definitions in each library.
//!
//! This crate will be deprecated once these traits land in stdlib. (See rust-lang/rfcs#393)
